# Misc. Notes/Considerations 

- Environmental impact of idling cars. Are 4-way stops more or less efficient than traffic lights?
- Use available highway traffic signs to notify drivers of nearby pursuit.
- Extend possible radius and alert all schools in potential area of pursuit.
- Check for any other events or activities scheduled in the area where people may be put in danger.
- Would my system give any kind of advantage to the suspect? If so, how can I mitigate that?
