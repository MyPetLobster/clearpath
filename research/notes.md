# Misc. Notes/Considerations 

- Environmental impact of idling cars. Are 4-way stops more or less efficient than traffic lights?
- Use available highway traffic signs to notify drivers of nearby pursuit.
- Extend possible radius and alert all schools in potential area of pursuit.
- Check for any other events or activities scheduled in the area where people may be put in danger.
- Would my system give any kind of advantage to the suspect? If so, how can I mitigate that?



# AI Summary of ClearPath

Task
State the problem you are planning to solve.

ClearPath PATS (Pursuit Activated Traffic System) aims to enhance public safety by automatically converting traffic signals in the path of emergency vehicles and police pursuits into 4-way blinking red stop lights, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and ensuring safer intersections.

Requirements
Describe the problem you are trying to solve for.
The primary problem is the high risk of accidents at intersections during emergency vehicle responses and police pursuits. Current systems often rely on manual updates and lack comprehensive automation to ensure all relevant intersections are made safer in real-time.

Describe any input data you expect to use.

GPS data from emergency vehicles (e.g., police cars, ambulances).
Real-time traffic signal status from city traffic management systems.
Voice inputs from dispatchers during pursuits for AI keyword detection.
Map data to identify intersections and road layouts.
Describe what the program will do to solve the problem.

Continuously track the GPS location of emergency vehicles.
Predict the potential path of these vehicles and identify intersections within this path.
Automatically change traffic lights within the predicted path to 4-way blinking red stop lights.
Use AI to listen for critical updates from dispatchers and adjust the path prediction and traffic light control accordingly.
Extend the safety zone (expanded cone) to include schools and public gatherings based on detected keywords and situational analysis.
Describe any outputs or results the program will provide.

Real-time updates to traffic signals, converting them to 4-way blinking red stop lights in the vehicle's path.
Visual and auditory alerts at intersections for pedestrians and drivers.
Logs of all changes made and the reasons for those changes.
Notifications to schools and public venues if they fall within the expanded danger zone.
Inspiration
Why do you want to solve this particular problem?
The idea is inspired by the need to improve public safety during critical situations involving emergency vehicles. Reducing the risk of accidents at intersections can save lives and ensure that emergency responders can perform their duties more effectively.

What source(s) of data do you believe you will need? Will the user need to supply that data, or will you get it from an external file or another source?

GPS Data: Provided by the emergency vehicle systems.
Traffic Signal Data: Obtained from city traffic management systems.
Map Data: Sourced from geographic information system (GIS) providers.
Voice Input: Real-time voice data from dispatchers.
Will you need to interact with the user throughout the program? Will users continually need to enter data in and see something to continue?

Minimal direct user interaction is expected. Most data will be obtained automatically from integrated systems.
Dispatchers may need to provide voice updates, which the AI Listener will process.
What are your expected results or what will be the end product? What will you need to tell a user of your program when it is complete?

End Product: A simulation demonstrating the ClearPath PATS system's functionality, showing real-time changes to traffic signals based on the movement of emergency vehicles.
User Information: Instructions on how to use the simulation, an overview of the system's benefits, and a summary of how it enhances public safety.
Summary
The ClearPath PATS simulation will showcase how advanced technologies can be integrated to create a safer environment for emergency responses and police pursuits. This project serves as a foundational step toward a fully operational system that can be deployed in real-world scenarios, enhancing public safety and response efficiency.
