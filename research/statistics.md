- Reporters merged this data with records from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find that at least 
3,336 people were killed as a result of police pursuits throughout the U.S. from 2017 through 2022. At least 15 of them 
were officers. More than 52,600 people were injured from 2017 through 2021, according to government estimates.

- Fatal pursuits have soared despite pledges to curtail them. The years 2020 and 2021 were the two deadliest on record according to NHTSA (commonly pronounced NITS-uh). At least 1,377 people died in police chases over that period, the Chronicle found.

- The federal government is significantly undercounting chase deaths. Reporters discovered 662 people who died from 2017 through 2021 but were missing from fatal pursuit data published by NHTSA. While the agency said it excludes cases in which an officer purposely rams a vehicle, for example, the Chronicle also found hundreds of deaths that appeared to be absent from its pursuit data due to reporting gaps and other unknown reasons.

- Most lethal pursuits started with low-level offenses, particularly traffic infractions: a broken tail light or a driver playing loud music, failing to fully stop at a stop sign or neglecting to wear a seat belt. In many cases, these chases were prohibited by agency policy.

- No binding national standard governs whether and how police should chase suspects, and many officers in fatal pursuits work for departments with loose “discretionary” policies that leave it to police to decide whether to initiate a chase.

- Taxpayers bear the brunt when pursuits hurt people: Local governments and insurers have paid at least $82 million in settlements and judgments in lawsuits concerning injuries or deaths caused by police pursuits since 2017, the Chronicle found. This is likely a significant undercount, given that some local governments refused to release key data — or said they didn’t track it.

- The Supreme Court hasn’t sided with any victim of a fatal police chase since it created qualified immunity, building up a body of case law that makes it even harder for families to sue. The court has ruled, among other things, that because pursuits involve split-second decisions, a police officer can’t violate an individual’s civil rights during them unless an attorney can prove the officer deliberately set out to harm that person. Many courts have since interpreted these rulings to mean that bystanders killed in police pursuits can’t sue an officer for violating their civil rights, said Patrick Jacoimo, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm.

- At least 551 bystanders died in chases over six years, the Chronicle found.

- More than 5,000 bystanders and passengers have been killed in police car chases since 1979, and tens of thousands more were injured as officers repeatedly pursued drivers at high speeds and in hazardous conditions, often for minor infractions, a USA TODAY analysis shows.

- Many in law enforcement, including the Justice Department, have recognized the danger of high-speed chases and urge officers to avoid or abort pursuits that endanger pedestrians, nearby motorists or themselves. At least 139 police have been killed in chases, federal records show.

- Police chases have killed nearly as many people as justifiable police shootings, according to government figures, which are widely thought to under count fatal shootings. Yet chases have escaped the national attention paid to other potentially lethal police tactics. Despite the Justice Department's warning, the number of chase-related deaths in 2013 was higher than the number in 1990 — 322 compared to 317, according to records of the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which analyzes all fatal motor-vehicle crashes. Many police departments still let officers make on-the-spot judgments about whether to chase based on their perception of a driver's danger to the public. Officers continue to violate pursuit policies concerning when to avoid or stop a chase, police records show. And federally funded high-tech systems that would obviate chases, such as vehicle tracking devices, are undeveloped or rarely used due to cost.

- At least 11,506 people, including 6,300 fleeing suspects, were killed in police chases from 1979 through 2013, most recent year for which NHTSA records are available. That's an average of 329 a year — nearly one person a day. But those figures likely understate the actual death toll because NHTSA uses police reports to determine if a crash was chase-related, and some reports do not disclose that a chase occurred.

- The number of innocent bystanders killed is impossible to pinpoint because hundreds of NHTSA's records fail to show whether a victim was killed in a car fleeing police or in a car that happened to be hit during a chase. Analyzing each fatal crash, USA TODAY determined that at least 2,456 bystanders were killed, although the death toll could be as high as 2,750. The newspaper found that 55% of those killed were drivers fleeing police. They ranged from armed-robbery suspects to a 10-year-old boy chased as he drove a pick-up truck 85 mph on a county road before hitting a tree, killing himself and his 7-year-old passenger. Injuries are even harder to count because NHTSA keeps records of only fatal crashes. However, records from six states show that 17,600 people were hurt in chases from 2004 through 2013 — an average of 1,760 injuries a year in those states, which make up 24% of the U.S. population. Those numbers suggest that chases nationwide may have injured 7,400 people a year — more than 270,000 people since 1979.

- At least 3,440 people were killed in crashes when a driver was fleeing at 25 mph or more over the speed limit, NHTSA records show. The actual death toll from such high-speed chases is likely much higher, but is not known because only half of NHTSA's records show a fleeing driver's speed and the speed limit.
